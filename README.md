# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-with-t-SNE

This is the Colab notebook for my individual research project in 2022 summer, my earliest experiences on NLP.

It uses LSTM, Multi kernal 1D CNN and KoBERT architectures to carry out sentiment analysis of movie reviews in Korean.

It then uses t-SNE embeddings, a non-linear dimension reduction technique, in order to effectively visualize and analyze the intermediate layers of each model.

Some of the results are shown below:
