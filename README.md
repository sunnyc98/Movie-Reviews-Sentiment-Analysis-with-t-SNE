# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-with-t-SNE

Colab notebook for my individual research project in 2022 summer, my earliest experiences on NLP.

It uses LSTM, Multi kernal 1D CNN and KoBERT architectures for the sentiment analysis of movie reviews in Korean.

It also uses t-SNE embeddings, a non-linear dimension reduction technique, to effectively visualize and analyze the intermediate layers of each model.
