# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-with-t-SNE

This is the Colab notebook for the research project I did 2022 summer.

It uses LSTM, Multi kernal 1D CNN and KoBERT architectures to carry out sentiment analysis of movie reviews in Korean.

It then uses t-SNE embeddings which is a non-linear dimension reduction technique, to visualize and analyze the intermediate layers of each model.

Some of the results are shown below:
